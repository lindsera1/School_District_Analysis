# School District Analysis

## Overview and Purpose

The School District Analysis was a project where I extensively used Pandas library to 
organize school district data across 15 different high schools, teaching nearly 40,000 students,
in order to reveal patterns across standardized test performance. We looked at this data in many
different ways; from the angle of how budgeting may have affected scores, or school population,
or whether the school type made a difference. All of this was gathered to help Maria, a chief data 
scientist for the district, to present these findings to the school board so they could make better informed
decisions as to where to allocate resources for the upcoming year. 

The challenge portion of this module, was to reevaluate Thomas High School's test score performance without the ninth grade
test scores, to see if there was much difference to support suspicions of academic dishonesty. Let's take a look at what we found...
